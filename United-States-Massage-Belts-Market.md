The digital landscape allows businesses to reach a wide audience, including those in rural or remote areas where physical retail outlets may be less accessible. Additionally, online sales offer the flexibility of home delivery and often feature promotions, discounts, and bundled offers, further encouraging consumer purchases. The growth of online shopping is expected to continue to fuel the expansion of the massage belts market. <p>Other distribution channels include direct sales through manufacturers' websites and smaller, specialized retailers that target niche markets, such as those focused on high-end wellness or specific therapeutic needs.
